# Woof-28-key-split-keyboard

## Description

If you hate moving your entire hand to reach keys, this 28-key collumnar staggered keyboard is for you.

It lacks the inner index collumn, and the upper pinky key has been moved to an easier to reach position.

## Design Inspiration:

I named it woof since it sort of looks like a dog's head.

The keyboard uses the same staggering and keyspacing as the Ferris keyboard, but the inner index collumns have been removed. 

The upper row pinky keys have been moved to a position thats easier to reach. This is inspired by the Osprette, although the upper pinky key positions aren't the same.
